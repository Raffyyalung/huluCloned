# huluCloned
During our training bootcamp, 
we participated in a group activity where we were tasked with cloning the website of Hulu.com using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 
It was an engaging and challenging project that allowed us to apply our skills and learn new techniques in website development. 
We were able to replicate the design and functionality of the Hulu website and gain hands-on experience working as a team.
Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that helped us improve our web development skills
